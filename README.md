**Welcome to the Pokémon Game Frontend!** 🎮 This exciting project is designed to offer a fun and interactive experience where
two players can immerse themselves in the world of Pokémon. In this simple yet engaging game, players can catch, train, and battle their
favorite Pokémon, all while interacting with a RESTful API that drives the gameplay.

The frontend is built using **React** for a dynamic and responsive user interface, complemented by **CSS/Bootstrap** to ensure a
polished and visually appealing design. **Axios** is utilized for seamless communication with the API, enabling smooth interactions
and real-time updates. Whether you're strategizing for battles or collecting new Pokémon, this game provides an entertaining way to 
experience the thrill of Pokémon battles with a friend.

Get ready to embark on a Pokémon adventure and see who emerges victorious! 🐾🕹️
